## Array Queue and Stack

### Queue

**First In First Out**

```
 [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

add(enqueue) push

move(dequeue) shift

`Example`
* A ticket stand
* Implementing A Cache

When a plate is added to a stack of dishes, the plate retains the order of when it was added; moreover, when a plate is added, it is pushed towards to the bottom of the stack, but it also represents the top of the stack of plates.


### Stack

**Last In First Out**

```
 [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

`Example`
* A stack of dinner plates
* recursive algorithms

push

pop
